                <h2><u>Piano</u></h2>
                <p>I started playing piano in November of 2021. My sister had brought inside an old electronic keyboard from the garage and began to play with it. It eventually peaked my interest and I began to play. I learned how to play from online tutorials on youtube. The first song I learned on piano was a song called Golden Hour by JVKE. I then began to learn songs that I liked on and off for about two years. One thing that I especially liked was how during elementary school, when we had music class, I was able to play piano and show-off my skills to my classmates, who were always excited and supportive of me. </p>
                <p>Then, in Christmas of 2023 my parents bought me a new electric keyboard and I was able to learn many songs that I wasn't able to play before. As of writing this (Febuary 2025), the last song I have learned in full was Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. I still love to learn and play songs on piano to this day. </p>

                <h2><u>Guitar</u></h2>
                <p>My father had been playing guitar for a long time before I was born. When I was little, I would watch him play his acoustic guitar. He would sing along and play songs he liked. </p>
                <p>However, I had only picked up the guitar in December of 2023 during winter break when I didn't have much to do. My sister had picked up acoustic guitar a few months prior, so I decided to try my dad's old electric one. The first song that I ever learned was a song called "Until I Found You" by Stephen Sanchez. </p>
                <p>However, my guitar playing began to really pick up when I learned the intro to "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses. It introduced me to the world of rock n' roll guitar and guitar solos in general. I taught myself how to play songs and read tabluture from youtube videos. I began to learn and enjoy many of the rock songs my dad listened to. </p>
                <p>Then, in June of 2024, my dad had bought me a new electric guitar and amplifier as a graduation present. I was able to learn many new songs and guitar solos with the new guitar, as well as different techniques and skills. As of writing this, the last song I have learned in full was "Hotel California" by the Eagles. I still enjoy learning new skills and songs on guitar and continue to do so. </p>
