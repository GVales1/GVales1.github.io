        <h3><u>History:</u></h3>
        <p> Filipino spaghetti was created in the late 19th century. It was requested by Americans who wanted dishes that reminded them of theirs homes. During World War II, the Philippines experienced a shortage of tomatoes. This means they also ran out of tomato-based ingredients, including ketchup, which was the most important condiment for Americans at the time. A woman named Maria Orosa created a way to create a similar substitute with bananas. One day, a man asked his Filipino staff to make spaghetti for him. They used the banana ketchup and replaced the meatballs with chopped up hot dogs. </p>
